# Weather Map App
This application displays a map and weather forecast for the requested location. An AJAX request is sent to the GoogleMaps API for geolocation which allows for autocompletion of the location field and displays a map of the location after the search. Another AJAX request sent to the openweathermap.org API retrieves a multi-day forecast for the location based on a latitude and longitude returned from the GoogleMaps API. Users can also drag and drop a pin to any location on the map and the forecast will update its location. I used flat design and flex box to make the application mobile responsive.
